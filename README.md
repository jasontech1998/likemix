## Overview

Spotify Share is an app designed to automate the sharing of your liked (or saved) songs from any album. This tool makes it easy for music enthusiasts to share their favorite tracks with friends effortlessly.

## Use Case

The primary use case of Spotify Share is to automate the process of sharing all your liked (or saved) songs from an album. 

## How It Works

1. **Login with Spotify:** Authenticate using Spotify's OAuth.
2. **View Albums:** The app displays the albums of your recently liked (or saved) songs.
3. **Select Album:** Click on an album to view all the saved songs from that album.
4. **Share Songs:** Click the "Share Songs" button to create a new playlist with all your saved songs from that album.
5. **Get Shareable Link:** A link to the newly created playlist is generated, allowing you to easily share it with your friends.

## Why I Built This

As a music enthusiast, I often discuss new albums with my friends and share which songs we liked the most. To streamline this process and make sharing easier, I built Spotify Share. After all, sharing is caring!
